## How to contribute
Contributions on this repository will follow the GitHub [Fork and Pull model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models). [This article](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/), written by [Scott Lowe](https://blog.scottlowe.org/about/), is a nice description of the complete process, complete with Git CLI commands.

The following assumes that you manage your GitHub repositories via[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), although other GUIs, such as [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/), should work equally well. Some additional steps are required when managing your fork via the Git CLI (see [Scott Lowe's article]((https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/)) for reference).

### Fork and clone repository
1. [Fork](https://github.com/nic-dgl-104-winter-2023/cr-design-patterns/fork) this repo (note that only public repositories can be forked)
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) your newly forked repo to your local machine

### Make some changes to the local
1. [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches) on your local
2. Commit changes to your new branch

### Push to the remote and PR
1. [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/pushing-changes-to-github) the new branch to GitHub
2. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request) back to the original forked repository

### Clean up your local
1. Delete the local copy of the merged branch
2. Pull from the upstream remote 
3. Push upstream changes to your fork
