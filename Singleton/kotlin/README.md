# Kotlin Singleton example
The code in the singleton/kotlin folder is based on the documentation from the [official Kotlin docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#object-declarations-overview). This is not a complete runnable solution, but contains the key elements of the Singleton pattern recommended by JetBrains.

## Contents of this folder
- **Singleton.kt**: An implementation of a Singleton in Kotlin
